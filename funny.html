We grew <span class="me">really</span> close in such little time <span class="gold">(5)</span> <span class="me">and</span> the jokes we made always made me smile and laugh <span class="gold">(3)</span> <span class="me">I really don't know how</span> somebody like you <span class="me">could</span> handle all my weirdness and stupidity <span class="gold">(3)</span>, <span class="me">but you chose to stick with me which meant a lot</span>. After those wonderful weeks at CTD, I finally manned up and asked you out <span class="gold">(1)</span>, <span class="me">which really</span> seems like only yesterday when <span class="me">I</span> asked <span class="me">you</span> over Skype haha. <span class="me">But to be honest</span> I still remember getting butterflies when <span class="me">I</span> started reading <span class="me">my</span> poem. <span class="gold">(3)</span> The day <span class="me">I</span> asked <span class="me">you</span> out was one of the happiest days <span class="gold">(1)</span> <span class="me">of my life</span>, and it's crazy to think that I wouldn't have met you if I hadn't gone to Chicago. <span class="gold">(3)</span> <span class="me">Ever since our departure</span> we <span class="me">still</span> talk everyday <span class="me">and</span> it never gets boring, <span class="gold">(5)</span> <span class="me">because</span> you always know how to make me smile and laugh <span class="gold">(2)</span>. Talking to you is always a highlight of my day <span class="gold">(2)</span> and when I say that it's not even an understatement! <span class="gold">(4)</span> <span class="me">Although you</span> don't laugh at my hilarious jokes <span class="gold">(2)</span> <span class="me">and</span> tease me a lot <span class="gold">(4)</span>, you're still the best never the less <span class="gold">(2)</span> <span class="me">and</span> i'm so absolutely blessed to have somebody like you <span class="gold">(3)</span> <span class="me">in my life</span>.
